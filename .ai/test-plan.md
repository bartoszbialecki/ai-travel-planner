## 4. Test scenarios for key functionalities

### 4.1 Travel plan generation

```
Scenario: User generates a travel plan
Steps:
1. User logs into the application
2. Goes to the plan generation page
3. Fills out the form (destination, dates, preferences, budget)
4. Clicks "Generate plan"
5. Waits for generation to complete
6. Checks the generated plan

Expected results:
- Plan is generated correctly
- Activities are logically ordered
- Cost information is realistic
- Plan can be edited and saved
```

### 4.2 Plan management

```
Scenario: User manages their plans
Steps:
1. User goes to the plans dashboard
2. Browses the list of their plans
3. Sorts plans by different criteria
4. Edits an existing plan
5. Deletes an unnecessary plan

Expected results:
- Plan list displays correctly
- Sorting works as expected
- Editing saves changes
- Deletion requires confirmation
```

### 4.3 Authentication

```
Scenario: Complete authentication cycle
Steps:
1. User registers a new account
2. Logs into the application
3. Performs operations requiring authentication
4. Logs out
5. Attempts to access protected resources

Expected results:
- Registration creates account in database
- Login creates session
- Protected resources are only available to logged-in users
- Logout destroys session
```
