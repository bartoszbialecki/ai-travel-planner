### Main Problem

Planning a detailed, personalized travel itinerary requires hours of research—finding attractions, restaurants, transportation, and estimating time and costs. This discourages travelers and leads to less satisfying trips.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Feature Set

- **AI-Generated Itinerary**  
  – Single-step form (destination, dates, travel style, budget)  
  – AI returns a day-by-day plan with times and activity descriptions
- **Manual Editing & Moderation**  
  – Accept/reject each activity  
  – Ability to edit descriptions via a text field
- **Save Itinerary**  
  – After review, save accepted activities as a final itinerary
- **Simple User Accounts**  
  – Sign up/log in (email & password or OAuth)  
  – Each user sees only their own itineraries
- **View Saved Itineraries**  
  – List of saved itineraries with options to open or delete

### Out of Scope for MVP

- Advanced map integrations (interactive routes, geolocation)
- Multiple alternative itinerary versions
- Itinerary sharing (public links, collaboration)
- Email/SMS notifications (travel-date reminders)
- Importing or syncing budgets from external sources
- Mobile applications (web only)

### Success Criteria

- **AI Usefulness**: At least 70% of AI-generated days are accepted without edits
- **AI Adoption**: 60% of users generate itineraries via AI (vs. creating manually)
- **User Retention**: At least 40% of new users save and view their first itinerary within 7 days of signup
- **Feedback**: Average satisfaction rating of itineraries (1–5 scale) ≥ 4.0
